 Netflix Movies Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a Netflix movie dataset to uncover patterns around genres, popularity, ratings, and release trends. Using Python and popular data analysis libraries, the goal is to transform raw movie data into meaningful insights through cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.

 What this project does

Analyzes 9,800+ movies with details like release year, genre, popularity, vote count, and average rating

Cleans and preprocesses the data (handles duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formats)

Converts release dates into years for trend analysis

Categorizes movie ratings into intuitive labels such as popular, average, and not popular

Splits multi-genre movies so each genre can be analyzed independently

Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear and informative visualizations

Key insights

Drama is the most frequent genre in the dataset

Movies labeled as “popular” make up the largest portion of viewer ratings

Spider-Man: No Way Home is the most popular movie in the dataset, dominating the Action, Adventure, and Science Fiction genres

The year 2020 recorded the highest number of movie releases

Popularity scores show strong outliers, indicating a few movies attract massive audience attention
